# Task-List
A simple application for managing your to-do list. The application allows the user to add, delete, and view tasks.
1. **Define the To-Do Item Class:**
   - Create a Java class to represent a to-do item. This class should have attributes such as a unique ID, a description of the task, a due date, and a status (completed or not).

2. **Create a Data Structure to Store To-Do Items:**
   - Use a suitable data structure to store the to-do items. Common choices include ArrayList or LinkedList for a simple implementation.

3. **Implement User Interface:**
   - Command-line user interface
   - For a command-line interface, use the Java Scanner class to get user input.

4. **Add To-Do Items:**
   - Allow the user to add new to-do items.
   - Collect information such as task description and due date from the user.
   - Create a new instance of the To-Do Item class and add it to your data structure.

5. **List To-Do Items:**
   - Display the list of to-do items to the user.
   - Iterate through your data structure and print the details of each to-do item.
   - You can provide options to filter or sort the list based on due date or completion status.

6. **Update To-Do Items:**
   - Allow the user to mark tasks as completed or update task descriptions or due dates.
   - Implement functionality to edit the to-do items and update the data structure accordingly.

7. **Delete To-Do Items:**
   - Provide an option to delete to-do items.
   - Remove the selected item from your data structure.

8. **Save and Load To-Do Items:**
   - Implement functionality to save the to-do list to a file (e.g., a text file or JSON).
   - Create methods to load the to-do list from a file when the application starts.

9. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement error handling to deal with incorrect user inputs or file operations.

10. **Testing and Debugging:**
    - Thoroughly test your application to ensure it works as expected.
    - Debug any issues that arise during testing.
